# Final Project: Create a markdown editor for personal notes

Start installing the framework with:
``` 
create-react-app note-manager
// to launch it, do:
cd note-manager
yarn Start
```
Then we add a styling manager called Miligram, more details here https://milligram.io
```
yarn add milligram
```
Then we add a simple md editor package that already exists :-)
```
yarn add react-simplemde-editor
```
